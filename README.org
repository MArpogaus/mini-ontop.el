** Introduction

mini-ontop is a small Emacs package that prevents the “jump” or recentering of
the main editing window whenever a multi-line minibuffer (for instance from
icomplete-vertical-mode) is triggered. By automatically adjusting point just
enough before showing the minibuffer, Emacs won’t force the screen to scroll.

This solves a common annoyance where pressing ~M-x~ or any other command that
opens a multi-line minibuffer can cause your main window to jump up a few lines
or flicker.

No special configuration is required—just enable ~mini-ontop-mode~ and enjoy
a calmer editing experience.

** Installation

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(use-package mini-ontop
  :ensure t
  :config (mini-ontop-mode 1))
#+end_src

** Customization

	•	mini-ontop-lines: By default, ~mini-ontop-lines~ attempts to compute a reasonable
estimate based on Emacs’ ~max-mini-window-height~. However, your
setup might need fine-tuning. If you still see jumps/flicker, try
increasing ~mini-ontop-lines~.
	•	mini-ontop-ignore-predicates: A list of zero-argument functions (predicates).
If any of these functions returns non-nil, mini-ontop will skip moving the
point up for that particular window/buffer combination. This is useful for
ignoring certain modes or commands (e.g., if you want to disable the behavior
while using ivy-yasnippet or other special minibuffer-driven workflows).
Example usage:
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(add-to-list ’mini-ontop-ignore-predicates (lambda () (bound-and-true-p ivy-yasnippet–active)))
#+end_src

These two options give you the flexibility to fine-tune mini-ontop so that it
“just works” in your environment, while still respecting any special cases.
